#When subsetting data using two conditions, the rows in the grid represented one condition while the columns represented another. We can express a third condition by generating multiple plots on the same subplot in the grid and color them differently. Thankfully, we can add a condition just by setting the hue parameter to the column name from the dataframe.

#Let's add a new condition to the grid of plots we generated in the last step and see what this grid of plots would look like.

#Instructions

# Use a FacetGrid instance to generate a grid of plots using the following conditions:
#The Survived column across the columns in the grid.
# The Pclass column across the rows in the grid.
# The Sex column using different hues.
# Each plot should be a kernel density plot of the "Age" column, with the area under the curve shaded.
# Each plot should have a height of 3 inches.
# Remove all of the spines using seaborn.despine().
# Display the plots.




g = sns.FacetGrid(titanic, col="Survived", row="Pclass", hue = "Sex", size = 3)
g.map(sns.kdeplot, "Age", shade=True)
sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)
plt.show()
